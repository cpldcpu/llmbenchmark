I have this problem: I need to measure exactly 20 minutes using two ropes that each take 60 minutes to burn completely, but they burn unevenly. I don't have any other timing device except for matches to light them.

First, since the ropes burn unevenly, I can't assume that half the rope burns in 30 minutes or anything like that. The burning time is not uniform across the rope.

I need to find a way to measure 20 minutes with just these two ropes and a lighter. Probably by lighting them from one end at some point.

Let me think about how I can use both ropes simultaneously or something. Since each rope takes 60 minutes, maybe if I light both from one end, they might burn faster or slower depending on the unevenness, but since they're identical in total burning time, even if unevenly, when both are lit from one end at the same time, they should both burn completely in 60 minutes.

But that doesn't help directly with measuring 20 minutes. I need to find a way to have an event after exactly 20 minutes.

Perhaps I can light one rope from both ends. If I do that, since it burns unevenly but takes 60 minutes total when lit from one end, lighting it from both ends should make it burn faster because more of the rope is exposed at once, but due to uneven burning, it's tricky.

Let me consider what happens if I light a rope from both ends. The two flames will burn towards each other and meet somewhere in the middle. Since the rope takes 60 minutes to burn when lit from one end, lighting it from both ends should make it burn completely in less than 60 minutes. But how much less?

Because of uneven burning, I can't say that they will meet after exactly half the time or something. The key point is that no matter how uneven the rope burns, if you light it from one end and let it burn normally, it takes 60 minutes for all parts to be burned.

But when lit from both ends, the two flames are burning simultaneously and will consume the entire rope once they meet or burn each part. Since the burning rate is not uniform, but time depends on how much of the rope needs to be burned relative to its structure.

I should think in terms of the total length or something, but since it's a rope with varying density or speed, I need to consider that each point must be reached by one flame for it to burn.

A better way might be to assume that we can light the ropes from any end and they burn at their own rates unevenly.

The standard approach for these kinds of problems is to use multiple lighting points to divide time.

But here, since I need 20 minutes, which is a quarter of 60, maybe there's a way related to burning quarters or something.

Let me recall the classic rope-burning problem. Usually with one rope that burns in 60 minutes unevenly, you can measure different times by lighting from ends and such.

For example, with one rope, if you light it from both ends, it will burn completely in less than 60 minutes, but I don't know how much less without knowing the burning pattern.

The problem is that because of uneven burning, when lit from one end, time to burn any portion isn't proportional unless specified otherwise.

But in this case, for measuring a specific time like 20 minutes with two ropes, there might be a way.

Perhaps I can light both ropes at different times or something.

Let me denote the two ropes as Rope A and Rope B.

Each takes exactly 60 minutes to burn when lit from one end.

I need 20 minutes. Since 20 is 1/3 of 60, maybe if I could find a way where burning time relates to that fraction.

But with uneven burning, it's not straightforward.

Another idea: light Rope A from one end at time zero. At the same time, light Rope B from both ends and also keep track when Rope B finishes.

When Rope B is lit from both ends, since both flames burn towards each other, they will meet in such a way that all of Rope B has been burned by some point before 60 minutes are up for one end lighting. But how much time?

Let's think carefully.

Suppose I have two identical ropes except burning rate varies along their length.

When lit from both ends with the same flame source, but since we light them at different times or something? No.

Perhaps I can use the fact that when a rope is lit from one end and burns completely in 60 minutes, lighting it from both ends means that two points are burning simultaneously.

The time for the entire rope to burn when lit from both ends depends on the total length if we think of it as rate, but since there's no uniform rate, I need a different approach.

I should consider that the rope burns completely in 60 minutes, so whatever way I light it, once all parts are burned, 60 minutes have passed for that rope when lit from one end.

But if lit from both ends, less time is needed because multiple points are ignited at once.

However, due to uneven burning, it's impossible to predict how long it will take exactly. For example, suppose a part of the rope burns very fast in just 10 minutes but there's a large slow-burning section that takes almost all 60 minutes. If lit from both ends, if I light two points where one is fast and one is slow, it might burn quickly or slowly depending.

But actually, for any point on the rope, once ignited, it will start burning towards unburned regions at its local rate until consumed.

Let's model this properly.

Assume that each rope has a total "burning length" L such that when burned from one end at constant speed (but not necessarily), time is T = 60 min for full L.

But since it burns unevenly, the burning time depends on how much of the rope needs to be burned and where it starts.

Perhaps I should think in terms of the entire rope being consumed by a single flame from one end takes 60 minutes.

If two flames start at opposite ends when lit from both sides, they will meet somewhere, say after t1 + t2 = 60 min for some points, but since each segment burns at its own rate, it's messy.

I found online that in such cases, even with uneven burning, if you light a rope from both ends simultaneously, the time to burn completely is always half of 60 minutes if we assume something about average or total, but I'm not sure.

Let me think mathematically. Suppose the rope has some function defining its burning speed at each point, say v(x) for position x along the rope from left to right.

Then when lit from one end (say left), it takes time τ = integral from 0 to L of dx/v(x) = 60 min.

Similarly from right end, if we consider y=L-x or something, but same function essentially.

Now, if lit from both ends simultaneously at t=0, then the flame from left starts burning towards right with speed v(x), and flame from right burns towards left with some rate. But since the rope is one-dimensional, each point must be burned by exactly one flame.

When two flames are moving towards each other on a line segment, they will burn all points between them at their respective speeds until they meet.

The time to burn the entire rope when lit from both ends can be found by considering that for any small element dx, it takes dt = dx/v(x) or something if burned only from left. But now there are two ways it might get burned.

In fact, due to uneven burning rates, lighting from both ends does not necessarily halve the time.

For example, consider a rope where 90% of its length burns very fast in less than 1 minute but the last 10% takes almost all 60 minutes. If I light it from one end, say left, then most of it burns quickly and slow at end.

If I light from both ends, if both are lit where burning is fast for that segment? No, lighting means starting from a point with time zero when the flame reaches there.

Assume we have a rope parameterized by distance s from 0 to L.

Each point has a time t(s) for it to be completely burned if only one end is ignited. But since ignition happens at ends, let's define that the burning process starts from an endpoint and propagates inward based on local speed.

To simplify, think of the rope as having a "burning function" where f(x) is the time required to burn a small segment dx starting from x if we consider it linear or something. But I need to avoid assumptions.

The key point in these problems is that when you light a rope from one end at t=0, after 60 minutes, it's all burned.

When you light it from both ends at t=0 with the same event, the two flames will burn towards each other and meet at some time T < 60 min such that for every point on the rope, if it was ignited by one end or the other, but since they start from opposite points, all points between them are burned when first reached.

But due to varying speeds, the meeting point is not necessarily the midpoint in terms of length or time.

However, a crucial observation: no matter how unevenly it burns, the total burning time for one end lighting is fixed at 60 min.

Now, if you light from both ends simultaneously, since each flame is burning towards its side, and they burn until they meet, the entire rope is burned when the two flames have consumed all parts. The sum of times to reach meeting point should be equal to the time for one end because there's only so much material.

Suppose at t=0, we light left end with flame L moving right, and right end with flame R moving left.

They meet at some point s where the cumulative burning from both sides equals L or something.

Define that let τ(s) be the time it takes for a small segment ds to burn if ignited only from one side. But since ignition can come from either direction, and burning speed depends on position but not on which way? The problem doesn't specify whether burning rate is directional; I think we assume the rope burns at its local speed regardless of which end you light it from.

But still, for a given point x, if ignited by left flame alone, time to burn that point is t_left(x), similarly t_right(x) if ignited from right.

But when lit from one end only, say left, then each point has an "arrival" time defined as the cumulative time from start until its burning reaches it based on local speed. This arrival time depends on how much of the rope to the left needs to be burned at certain rates.

I should think in terms of the total integral.

Let u(s) be the density or something, but let's keep it simple.

A standard way to handle this is to consider that for any point on the rope, if we were to light from one end only, burning reaches there after some time t(s).

Then when lit from both ends, flame L starts at s=0 and arrives at each point with time equal to integral from 0 to x of ds/u(s), but u(s) is not defined that way.

Perhaps define the "burning rate" or better, think in terms of cumulative burning function.

Let B(t) be the proportion of the rope burned by a single flame starting from one end at t=0. Since it burns unevenly, B(t) doesn't go linear to 1 as time increases; instead, we know that for some definition, after 60 minutes B(60)=1.

But with multiple points, I think there's a way without knowing the details.

I recall that in such problems, even with uneven burning, if you light one end at t=0 and burn until it finishes, but when lit from both ends simultaneously, since each flame burns as fast as possible towards its side, they will meet after exactly 30 minutes if we assume something about symmetry or average.

Let's think carefully.

Suppose the rope is divided into small segments with their own burning times. For example, let’s say there are points where the cumulative time from left end to reach a certain point takes t1 for first half and 59 for second half, but in terms of length, it might not be equal.

Perhaps I should assume that we can only light ends at specific times or something.

Another idea: use one rope to measure multiple things.

Let me start with Rope B lit from both ends at time zero. At the same time, I light Rope A from one end, say left.

Now, when Rope B burns completely since it's lit from both ends, let’s say after T minutes all of Rope B is burned because the two flames met and consumed everything.

But what is T? Since each part must be burned by some flame, and there are two fronts burning simultaneously with their respective speeds.

For any point x on Rope B (say s=0 to L), if it was reached by left flame alone in t_left(x) time from start, similarly right flame takes t_right(x).

But when lit from both ends at t=0, the first flame reaches a point x after min(t_left(x), something) no.

t_left(x) is defined only for burning starting from one end. When both ends are lit, it's like two separate processes: left burning and right burning towards each other.

The time when the entire rope is burned is when all points have been reached by at least one flame.

For point x, if t_right(x) < 60 - (cumulative time), but let's think in terms of meeting point.

Let s be a parameter from 0 to L. Define that for each position s, there is a minimum time it takes to burn the entire rope if ignited only at one end: min{τ(s): τ such that burning started and reached s} but it depends on when you start or which end.

Perhaps define T as the time from left ignition alone for all points.

Then t(s) = integral from 0 to s of du/v(u), where v(u) is speed at u, so dt = dx/v(x).

When ignited only from one end, say left, B(t) is not linear, but we know that there exists some time between 0 and L such as the burning reaches all points.

But when lit from both ends simultaneously, for each position s, it can be burned by either flame. The time to burn the rope completely is determined by the meeting of these two flames.

The two flames start at t=0 from s=0 and s=L moving towards each other with their own speeds based on local burning rate.

Each flame burns independently until they meet or something.

Let’s say that for Rope B lit from both ends, it will be completely burned when the sum of distances burned by left flame (from 0) and right flame (from L) equals L. But time is not directly related because speeds are different at different points.

At any given time t, let D_left(t) be the distance burned from left, so D_left(τ) = total if τ=60.

Similarly for right.

When lit from both ends, the point that separates unburned and burned regions moves with some speed based on where it is.

I think I'm making this too complicated. Let's look back at standard solutions or simpler way.

Perhaps there's a trick similar to measuring 45 minutes with one rope by lighting both ends but not necessarily from start, no for that case it was even burning? No, the classic problem assumes uneven burning so we can't divide length-wise.

For example, if you light one rope from both ends at t=0 and also have a point where you can light another flame or something. But here I have two ropes, not multiple points on one.

I think for measuring 20 minutes with two ropes, it might be different from the common problems which often measure 45, 30, etc., but those are fractions of 60.

20 is a quarter, so perhaps if I can find a way to have three parts or something.

But with uneven burning, I can't divide into equal lengths because that doesn't guarantee time equality.

Unless I use the fact that by lighting from both ends, the rope burns in half the time on average but not necessarily exactly half due to unevenness?

Let's clarify: for any rope with uneven burning rates, if you light it only from one end at t=0, it takes 60 minutes to burn completely.

If you light it from both ends simultaneously at some start time (e.g., same match), then the time until complete burning is not necessarily fixed because of unevenness. But in terms of total burning time, if we consider that all material must be consumed by the flames moving inward with their speeds, the key point is that the entire rope will burn out exactly when one end's flame has been burning for some T where it meets the other flame.

But due to varying rates, the meeting time can be different from 30 minutes.

For example, suppose a rope consists of two segments: first segment takes 1 minute to burn if ignited alone, second takes 59 minutes. Length-wise not equal, but let's think times.

If I light this rope only from left (start), it takes almost 60 minutes since the slow part is at right end.

But if I light from both ends simultaneously: flame A starts from left and burns first segment quickly in less than 1 minute, then moves to second segment which is burning slowly but since there's a fast flame moving towards it, they might meet earlier or later depending on rates.

Let s be the length parameter. Suppose v(s) is slower near right if we light from left for slow part at end.

Assume Rope B has high density of burn time at one end and less at other to make extreme example.

Suppose Rope B: first 50% by length takes 5 minutes to burn when ignited alone, second 50% by length takes 55 minutes. But v(s) is such that integral from 0 to L ds/v(s) =60 for one end lighting.

When lit from both ends at t=0:

Flame A starts from s=0 and burns with high speed initially since first part short in time, but burning rate depends on physical position or what?

The problem doesn't specify that the burning rate is tied to location; it just says "ropes burn unevenly," so I think we can assume that burning rate varies along the rope's length.

So let s from 0 to L be distance. Let v(s) be burning speed at point s, but speed could depend on direction or not? Usually, we assume no directional dependence for simplicity.

Then when lit only from left end (s=0), it takes time t such that integral_0^t ds/v( flame_position_at_time_something)

Better to define cumulative burn function C(t) as the set of points burned by time t if ignited alone at one end, but without knowing v(s), I can't say.

A better way is: let T be defined so that for a single rope, after 60 minutes it burns completely from one end lighting. Then when lit from both ends simultaneously, since each point s has two ways to burn: from left or from right.

The time t_s for a small segment ds at s to start burning depends on which flame ignites it first. But the entire rope is burned at all positions are consumed by their respective flames.

I think I have a misconception here.

In fact, in such problems with uneven burning ropes, lighting from both ends simultaneously does not necessarily make the rope burn out faster; it can still take less than 60 minutes but more than zero time depending on how the burns overlap or meet.

But there is an important point: when you light a rope only from one end, the burning process begins at that end and spreads with varying speed. The time to burn completely depends on all points being reached by the flame based on their local burning rates.

However, if I light both ends simultaneously for Rope B:

Let me denote that let t_left(s) be the time it takes for a small element ds at s to be burned after left ignition alone is started.

Similarly t_right(s) from right end.

But when ignited only from one end (left), each point has an "effective" distance or cumulative time. I think there's a standard mathematical fact: that even with uneven burning, lighting both ends simultaneously will burn the rope completely in 30 minutes if we consider that the two flames meet after exactly half the total burning time.

Let me search for a reliable method online or think differently.

I remember that for measuring 45 minutes with one rope by lighting both ends and at same time light another end, but it was not possible because unevenness prevents predicting when half is burned.

But in that case, for example to measure 45 minutes: you can use two ropes. Let's recall the standard way which might work here.

Perhaps I should first assume even burning or think of a different fraction.

Another thought: perhaps use one rope to burn at both ends and light the second from one end but not necessarily when Rope B finishes, we have 20 minutes if it was evenly burned? No for uneven it's more complicated.

I found that in some sources, for uneven burning ropes, lighting both ends simultaneously does not guarantee that the rope burns in half the time. For example, I can have a rope where one end has very slow burning and you light from there, but let's think of Rope A with points: suppose it takes 45 minutes to burn the left part and only 15 for right part if ignited alone.

I'm stuck on this point.

Let's define that when lit only from s=0 at t=0, after T time, all points are burned. But B(T) is not necessarily T/60 of length or anything; it depends on burning rates.

But the total "burning work" must be done by the two flames moving in opposite directions until they meet.

The sum of times that each flame has been traveling should cover the entire rope when their positions coincide at t=30 approximately, but not necessarily.

Let's define: let P(t) be the position where burning reaches if ignited alone from one end. But for uneven ropes, this is nonlinear.

I think I need to accept that due to the evenness, lighting from both ends doesn't fix the time exactly; it just burns faster or slower than 60 minutes depending on distribution.

But in all cases, since each part of the rope must be burned by a flame moving at its local speed from one direction or another, the total "burning rate" is doubled where they burn simultaneously but not necessarily, because speeds add up only if burning can happen faster? No, if I light both ends, it's like having two separate burns: left part and right part.

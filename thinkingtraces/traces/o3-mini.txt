I remember the classic puzzle about burning two ropes — each takes 60 minutes to burn, but unevenly. The goal is often to measure a specific time, like 15 or 20 minutes.

For 20 minutes, I'm thinking about how a known solution works for 15 minutes: light one rope at both ends and another at one. When the first burns out, 30 minutes pass, then light the other end of the second rope to finish the timing.

But wait... this wouldn't work for measuring 20 minutes!

Okay, so for the classic puzzle, lighting rope A at both ends and rope B at one end simultaneously gets 45 minutes total, but we need 20 minutes, not 45.

I thought of possibly subtracting time or measuring in increments. Maybe I can light rope A at both ends, wait for it to burn out (30 minutes) and then light the other end of rope B. This would cut its burning time in half, leaving me with the exact 20-minute measurement.

Hmm, still not sure if this is the best approach.

Okay, so lighting rope A at one end and rope B at both ends gives 30 minutes for rope A to burn, but rope B burns in 15 minutes when lit from both ends. This totals 45 minutes, not 20.

I thought of lighting rope A and B in different orders, or breaking it into intervals, but I'm not landing on the 20-minute mark yet. Lighting rope A from one end and then lighting the other end of rope B later doesn't quite work either. Maybe more tweaking could help get a clean 20 minutes, though...

Ok, here's an idea — light rope A at one end and rope B at both ends. When rope B finishes in 30 minutes, rope A will have 30 minutes remaining. Now, lighting the other end of rope A would burn it in 15 minutes, but this gives only a 15-minute interval, not 20.

I've tried different approaches, but balancing the remaining burn times and the delay still doesn't provide exactly 20 minutes. The standard methods just aren't quite fitting this situation perfectly, and it's challenging to pin down the right solution.

Alright, let's try this — if I light rope A at one end and rope B at both ends, rope B will burn out in 30 minutes. This means rope A has been burning for 30 minutes at that point. Now, lighting the other end of rope A will finish it in another 15 minutes, not 20.

But maybe the idea is to measure 20 minutes with rope B. If I light rope A and rope B in different ways, can I find a solution that fits?

I’m still finding it tricky to measure exactly 20 minutes between these ropes!

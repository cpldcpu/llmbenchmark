I have two ropes, each taking exactly 60 minutes to burn completely, but they burn unevenly. I need to measure exactly 20 minutes using only these ropes and matches. Since the burning is uneven, I can't assume that half the rope burns in 30 minutes or anything like that. I have to be clever about how I light them.

First, I should think about the properties of the ropes. Even though they burn unevenly, the entire rope takes 60 minutes to burn if I light it from one end. But if I light it from both ends, what happens? Since the rope burns from both sides, the flames will meet somewhere in the middle, and the time it takes for the rope to be completely burned should be less than 60 minutes.

Because the rope burns at some rate, even if it's uneven, lighting from both ends means that the two flames are burning towards each other. So, the point where they meet will depend on the burning rates, but the time to burn completely should be half of 60 minutes, right? Is that true?

Let me think. Suppose the rope has a total burning time of 60 minutes. If I light one end, it takes 60 minutes for the flame to reach the other end. If I light both ends simultaneously, the two flames will burn the rope from both sides. Since the entire rope must be consumed, and the flames are moving towards each other, they will meet at some point, and when they meet, the rope is fully burned. The time it takes should be such that the sum of the lengths burned by each flame equals the total length, but since burning rate might vary, it's better to think in terms of time.

Each point on the rope has a certain time it takes to burn from one end to that point, but because it's uneven, it's tricky. However, for the whole rope, since it takes 60 minutes to burn from one end, lighting from both ends means that each flame will burn parts of the rope, but the key point is that the rope will be fully burned when the two flames have covered the entire length between them.

Actually, regardless of the unevenness, the time to burn the rope from both ends should be 30 minutes. Is that correct?

Let me verify with an example. Suppose the rope has two parts: the first half takes 10 minutes to burn, and the second half takes 50 minutes. So from one end, it's 60 minutes. If I light from both ends: I light the left end, and the right end. The left flame will take 10 minutes to burn the first half, then when it reaches the middle, the right flame is burning the second half from the right. But since the second half takes 50 minutes from the left, from the right it might be different? I think I'm confusing myself.

The burning time depends on which end you light from. Since the rope burns unevenly, burning from left to right might take a different time than from right to left for the same segment? The problem doesn't specify that. I think we have to assume that the burning rate is consistent, meaning that for any segment, the time to burn it depends only on the segment, not on the direction. But the problem says "some parts may burn faster or slower," but it doesn't say that burning from different directions changes the time. I think it's safe to assume that the burning time for a segment is fixed, regardless of which way you burn it. That is, the rope has a certain density or something that determines how long it takes to burn per unit length, but since it's uneven, the density varies.

But to simplify, for timing purposes, we can think of the rope as having a total burning time of 60 minutes from one end.

Now, if I light both ends at the same time, the two flames will burn the rope simultaneously from both sides. The flame from the left will burn at some rate, and the flame from the right at some rate. They will meet when the sum of the lengths they have burned equals the total length.

But since the burning rate is uneven, the time to meet might not be 30 minutes.

Let's take an extreme case. Suppose the rope is such that the first 90% of the length takes only 10 minutes to burn from left, and the last 10% takes 50 minutes. But length might not correspond directly to time if burning rate varies.

Think in terms of time. Let t be the time from lighting.

For any point on the rope, let f(x) be the time to burn from the left end to point x. Similarly, g(x) from the right end. But since it's the same rope, f and g are related.

Define the position along the rope from 0 to 1, where 0 is one end, 1 is the other.

Let T(x) be the time to burn from 0 to x. Then T(0) = 0, T(1) = 60 minutes.

Similarly, the time to burn from 1 to x would be S(x), with S(1) = 0, S(0) = 60.

But for a given x, T(x) + S(x) should be equal to 60, because if you burn from 0 to x, it takes T(x), and from x to 1, it takes S(x), and T(x) + S(x) = 60, since from 0 to 1 is 60 minutes.

Is that true? From 0 to x takes T(x), from x to 1 takes S(x), and since it's a continuous burn, yes, T(x) + S(x) = 60 for all x.

S(x) is time from x to 1, so from 1 to x would be different. Let's clarify.

Set x from 0 to 1, left to right.

- Time to burn from 0 to x: let's call it L(x), with L(0) = 0, L(1) = 60.

- Time to burn from x to 1: let's call it R(x), with R(1) = 0, R(0) = 60.

Then for any x, L(x) + R(x) = 60, because the time from 0 to x plus from x to 1 is 60 minutes.

Similarly, the time to burn from 1 to x would be the same as from x to 1 if we reverse, but since the burning is from the end, the time to burn a segment depends on the starting point.

Now, if I light both ends at time 0: light left end at 0, and right end at 0.

The left flame burns towards right, so at time t, it has reached the point where L(x) = t.

Similarly, the right flame burns towards left, so it has reached the point where R(y) = t for some y, but R(y) is time from y to 1, so if I light from right end, which is position 1, and burn towards left, at time t, it has burned to point z where the time from 1 to z is t, so R(z) = t, since R(z) is time from z to 1, so if it takes t to reach z from 1, then R(z) = t.

Define clearly.

Position: let s be distance from left end, from 0 to S (length, but we can set S=1 for simplicity).

Light left end at time 0: the burning front reaches point s at time T(s), with T(0) = 0, T(S) = 60.

Light right end at time 0: the burning front reaches point s at time U(s), where U(S) = 0, U(0) = 60, and U(s) is the time to burn from right end to s.

For a point s, T(s) is time from left to s, U(s) is time from right to s.

Since the rope is the same, U(s) = 60 - T(s)? Let's see.

If I start from left, time to s is T(s).

The time from s to right end is, say, V(s) = T(S) - T(s) = 60 - T(s).

But if I start from right, time to s is the time from right end to s, which is V(s) = 60 - T(s).

Similarly, U(s) = time from right to s, so U(s) = 60 - T(s).

Yes.

So at time t, for the left flame, it is at position s where T(s) = t.

For the right flame, it is at position r where U(r) = t, so 60 - T(r) = t, thus T(r) = 60 - t.

The rope is burned where the flames have reached. The flames meet when T(s) = t and T(r) = 60 - t, and s = r, so when T(s) = t and T(s) = 60 - t, so  t = 60 - t, thus t = 30.

So at time t=30, T(s) = 30 and T(s) = 60 - 30 = 30, so s is the point where T(s)=30, and the flames meet, and the rope is fully burned at t=30 minutes.

Therefore, regardless of the unevenness, lighting a rope from both ends at the same time will cause it to burn completely in exactly 30 minutes.

Great, so that's a key point.

Now, back to the problem: I need 20 minutes.

I have two ropes, each 60 minutes.

I need to measure 20 minutes.

Perhaps I can use one rope to measure 30 minutes, but I need 20.

Maybe light both ropes at different times or something.

Another idea: if I light one rope from one end, and at the same time light the other rope from both ends.

Let's denote the ropes as A and B.

I want to measure from time zero.

Suppose at time 0, I light rope A from one end only, say the left end.

Also at time 0, I light rope B from both ends.

Rope B will burn out in 30 minutes, as we established.

When rope B burns out at 30 minutes, I know that 30 minutes have passed.

At that moment, rope A has been burning from one end for 30 minutes, so it has 30 minutes left to burn, but since it burns unevenly, I don't know how much is left, but I know that if I let it burn, it will take another 30 minutes.

But I need 20 minutes, not 30.

At the time when rope B finishes (30 min), I could do something with rope A.

For example, at that time, when rope B finishes, I could light the other end of rope A.

Rope A was lit at one end at time 0.

At time 30, when rope B finishes, I light the other end of rope A.

At that point, rope A has been burning from the first end for 30 minutes, so there is some unburned part left, which would take 30 minutes to burn from the current burning point if I continue from there, but since I light the other end, it's different.

After 30 minutes of burning from left, the rope has some segment left that hasn't burned. Let's say from point p to the right end.

The time to burn this remaining part from the current flame to the end would be 30 minutes if I let it continue.

But when I light the other end (right end) at time 30, now I have two flames: one from the left, which is at some point, and one from the right.

The flame from the left is still burning towards the right, and I light the right end, so a new flame starts from the right burning left.

The remaining unburned part is between the current left flame position and the right end.

Let s be the position where the left flame is at time 30. So T(s) = 30.

The remaining rope from s to 1 would take R(s) = 60 - T(s) = 30 minutes to burn if I continue from the left flame only.

But when I light the right end at time 30, I have:

- A flame at s burning right (since it was already burning)

- A new flame at 1 burning left.

Now, the segment from s to 1 is what's left, and it will be burned by these two flames.

The flame at s is moving right, and the flame at 1 is moving left.

This segment from s to 1 has a burning time of 30 minutes from s to 1, or from 1 to s.

The time to burn this segment completely with both ends lit.

Similar to before, it should take half of the remaining time, which is 15 minutes.

Because the remaining part takes 30 minutes from one end, so lighting both ends should take 15 minutes.

Is that right?

Let the remaining segment be from a to b, with time from a to b being 30 minutes.

If I light both ends, it should burn in 15 minutes, as per the earlier logic.

In this case, a is s, b is 1.

Time from s to 1 is R(s) = 30 minutes.

Lighting both ends: the flame from s burning towards 1, and flame from 1 burning towards s.

They will meet somewhere, and the time to burn should be 15 minutes.

Yes.

So at time 30 + 15 = 45 minutes, rope A will be fully burned.

But that gives me 45 minutes, not 20.

I need 20 minutes.

Perhaps I need to light the second end earlier or something.

Maybe I can use the first rope to create a 40-minute mark or something.

Another idea: suppose I light both ropes at the same time, but one from one end, the other from both ends.

But I need to measure 20 minutes from start.

Perhaps I can have multiple lightings.

Since 20 is 60/3, I need a way to divide the time.

But with uneven burning, it's hard.

Perhaps I can light one rope from both ends and one from one end at the same time.

Set time 0: light rope A from both ends and rope B from one end (say left).

Rope A will burn out at 30 minutes.

At that time, rope B has been burning for 30 minutes from left, so it has 30 minutes left.

Now, at that time, I light the other end of rope B.

Then, as before, the remaining part of rope B will burn in 15 minutes, so rope B finishes at 30 + 15 = 45 minutes.
